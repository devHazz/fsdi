FSDIntercept. A tool built whilst research was conducted on the FSD Protocol 

## How did this come about?
Decided to do some research into the FSD Protocol used by VATSIM and IVAO, then build a tool out of it

## Current Issues
 - Some packets may have concatenated payloads (Thanks to FSD) so when parsing the packet, it may or may not show both payloads.
